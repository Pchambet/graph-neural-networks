Exploring and learning Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) step by step.


# 🧠 Graph Neural Networks (GNN) – Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository where I learn and explore Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) from scratch.

## 📚 Goals

- Understand the theoretical foundations of GNNs
- Implement core models such as GCN, GAT, GIN, etc.
- Apply GNNs to real-world tasks (e.g. molecular property prediction, social networks...)
