# What the Funk is Deep Learning?

Welcome to *my personal repository* where I dive deep into Deep Learning — from scratch, with patience, tenacity, and curiosity.

## Why This Exists
 
Today, you stand before this notebook, and I see someone who wants things to change.  
But most importantly, I see someone who is ready to take full responsibility for their learning.

That's rare.  
But who said that *pearls are easy to find*?

Welcome to a notebook written by someone who once asked the same question you're asking now:  
**"WTFunk is Deep Learning? How does this REALLY work?"**

This notebook is hard.  
But this notebook is also a journey — one that will take you from basic neurons to cutting-edge architectures.  
And don’t worry. I’m not a teacher. I’m a learner — just like you.  
But I’ve made a choice.  
And if you’re reading this, **so have you**.

The rest is just tenacity.

## Structure of the Notebook

This repo is split into two main parts:

### 1. Theoretical Part
A beginner-friendly yet rigorous walkthrough of the *core concepts*.  
Includes:
- Simple explanations
- Intuitive examples
- Visual illustrations
- Backpropagation math, activation functions, cost functions, and more.

### 2. Practical Part
Hands-on coding tutorials to implement what you've learned.  
Includes:
- Building neural networks from scratch (NumPy)
- Implementing key algorithms step by step
- Real-world applications: *Molecular Property Prediction*, etc.

## Final Words

This is not just code.  
This is not just theory.  
This is **your learning journey**, with all its doubts, breakthroughs, and realization moments.

Stay curious. Stay tenacious. Let’s go.
