# Graph Neural Networks (GNN) – Learning Journey

Welcome to my personal repository where I learn and explore Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) from scratch.

##  Goals

- Understand the theoretical foundations of GNNs
- Implement core models such as GCN, GAT, GIN, etc.
- Apply GNNs to real-world tasks (molecular property prediction)
